    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This project set out to achieve the following objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement Neural Style Transfer (NST)**  \n",
    "   - Implement using TensorFlow (Gatys, TF-Hub Johnson, AdaIN).  \n",
    "   - Integrat PyTorch specifically for LPIPS perceptual similarity evaluation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Allow style transfer between arbitrary content and style images**  \n",
    "   - Achieve through a batch stylisation pipeline supporting multiple content–style pairs.  \n",
    "   - Supported dynamic control of style strength (α:β ratios).  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Produce high-quality stylised results with perceptual optimisation**  \n",
    "   - Compare three state-of-the-art NST approaches (Gatys, TF-Hub Johnson, AdaIN).  \n",
    "   - Enhance results presentation through grids, GIFs, and interactive sliders.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Support accessibility and inclusivity in visual AI**  \n",
    "   - Explore how stylisation can enhance creative engagement and visual accessibility (e.g., users with low vision experiencing high-contrast artistic transformations).  \n",
    "   - Add interactivity (sliders, comparisons) to make outputs understandable to both technical and non-technical audiences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluate generated outputs using quantitative and qualitative methods**  \n",
    "   - Quantitative: SSIM (structural similarity), LPIPS (perceptual similarity), and execution time.  \n",
    "   - Qualitative: Peer feedback (Likert-scale survey + comments).  \n",
    "   - Combine both into comparative tables and visualisations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Extend NST to video for dynamic experiences**  \n",
    "   - Implemente frame-by-frame video stylisation.  \n",
    "   - Produce both MP4 and GIF outputs with multiple styles and a 4-way comparison video.  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Reflect on original contributions and future directions in inclusive AI**  \n",
    "   - Original contributions:  \n",
    "     - Full pipeline integration across models + evaluation + interactivity.  \n",
    "     - “Wow factor” elements: animated transitions, interactive notebook sliders, video NST.  \n",
    "     - Planned deployment as a **Streamlit web app** for public use.  \n",
    "   - Future work:  \n",
    "     - Transformer-based real-time NST.  \n",
    "     - Larger-scale user studies for accessibility applications.  \n",
    "     - Deployment of NST for creative and educational purposes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook reflects the plan outlined in my formal report and exceeds the baseline requirements to meet academic, technical, and creative standards."

    "- **Content Loss**: Measures the difference between content image features and the generated image features from deeper VGG layers.\n",
    "- **Style Loss**: Measures the difference between Gram matrices (i.e., feature correlations) of style image and the generated image across multiple shallow layers.\n",

    "In this experiment, I implemented the seminal optimization-based Neural Style Transfer (NST) method proposed by Gatys et al. (2015, 2016). This approach frames style transfer as an image optimization problem, where a generated image is iteratively updated to minimize a weighted sum of **content loss** (measuring structural similarity to the content image) and **style loss** (measuring the difference in feature correlations via Gram matrices).\n",

    "The **content representation** was extracted from the `block5_conv2` layer of the pre-trained VGG-19 network, capturing high-level semantic structure while discarding low-level texture details. The **style representation** was computed from multiple convolutional layers (`block1_conv1`, `block2_conv1`, `block3_conv1`, `block4_conv1`), enabling the preservation of multi-scale texture statistics. Gram matrices were employed to capture style as the correlations between filter responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this run, I selected **α:β = 1:0.01** to prioritize style features while still preserving recognizable content structure, and performed **1000 optimization iterations (epochs)**. This high iteration count was chosen to maximize stylization fidelity, producing rich, fine-grained texture synthesis and a well-blended style-to-content mapping. As shown in the loss trajectory, both style and total losses decreased consistently, while content loss stabilized, indicating convergence to a visually optimal solution.\n",

    "## Phase 4.1 — Batch Stylisation of Content–Style Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase, I systematically generate stylised outputs for all combinations of curated content and style images using three neural style transfer (NST) approaches: (i) **Gatys et al.**’s optimisation-based method, (ii) the **fast feed-forward Johnson et al.** model via TensorFlow Hub, and (iii) **Adaptive Instance Normalisation (AdaIN)** (Huang & Belongie, 2017). The purpose of running all combinations is to produce a complete stylisation dataset that enables both **qualitative comparison** (visual inspection) and **quantitative evaluation** (metrics computed in Phase 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodological Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Combinatorial Coverage**: By applying all three models to every possible content–style pairing, I ensured a robust comparison. This reduces the risk of cherry-picking results, a problem often noted in qualitative NST evaluations (Jing et al., 2020).\n",
    "- **Controlled Resolution**: All inputs are resized to a uniform 512×512 pixels to maintain fairness in execution time measurements (Li et al., 2022) and output quality.\n",
    "- **Systematic Naming & Logging**: Outputs are saved using consistent filenames and logged in a structured CSV file, enabling reproducibility and traceability.\n",
    "- **Model Diversity**: \n",
    "  - Gatys et al.’s method captures high-quality style features through iterative optimisation but is computationally expensive.\n",
    "  - Johnson et al.’s model sacrifices flexibility for speed by pre-training for specific styles.\n",
    "  - AdaIN achieves real-time arbitrary style transfer, making it suitable for video and interactive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "While batch stylisation provides breadth of evaluation, it introduces **computational cost trade-offs**. Gatys’ method, despite its superior fidelity, becomes impractical for large-scale stylisation or video frames due to its iterative nature (Gatys et al., 2016). In contrast, AdaIN and feed-forward models can process hundreds of images in seconds but may exhibit reduced style–content alignment in complex artistic textures. These trade-offs will be explicitly quantified in Phase 5.\n"

    "To critically evaluate the influence of the content–style trade-off, I conducted experiments varying the α:β ratio within the Gatys et al. (2016) framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **α (content weight)** controls how much of the original content structure is preserved.\n",
    "- **β (style weight)** controls how strongly the target style’s texture and colors dominate the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Setup\n",
    "I tested three configurations:\n",
    "1. **Style-heavy:** α = 1e3, β = 1e-1\n",
    "2. **Balanced:** α = 1e3, β = 1e-2\n",
    "3. **Content-heavy:** α = 1e1, β = 1e-3\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimisation is run for **500 iterations** per configuration to ensure style patterns have time to emerge. The same content–style pair is used across all experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "These variations allow us to observe the qualitative shifts in visual dominance and structural preservation. The expectation, supported by Gatys et al. (2016), is:\n",
    "- Style-heavy: strong style texture and color, less content fidelity.\n",
    "- Balanced: trade-off between recognisable structure and stylistic texture.\n",
    "- Content-heavy: strong structural fidelity, reduced style intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Critically, this ratio acts as a **trade-off parameter**, with higher α favouring the original image’s structure and higher β favouring artistic abstraction. Empirical evidence suggests that fine-tuning this ratio is essential for achieving the desired perceptual balance in stylisation (Ruder et al., 2016; Gatys et al., 2016).\n",

    "In this experiment, I selected one representative content–style pair to generate three stylisations under varying α:β ratios. The results are presented side-by-side for qualitative comparison.\n",

    "### Phase 4.3 — Video Neural Style Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "The application of Neural Style Transfer to video is a compelling extension of image-based NST, enabling artistic transformations of entire sequences. This stage uses a *fast* feed-forward model (Johnson et al., 2016; Huang & Belongie, 2017) to stylise each frame of a short video in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**\n",
    "- Optimisation-based methods such as Gatys et al. (2016) are prohibitively slow for video due to iterative gradient updates.\n",
    "- Feed-forward architectures (e.g., Johnson’s perceptual loss network, AdaIN) achieve near real-time performance by applying style in a single forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipeline Overview:**\n",
    "1. **Frame Extraction** — Input video is decomposed into individual frames.\n",
    "2. **Frame Stylisation** — Each frame is processed using a pre-trained fast NST model (PyTorch AdaIN).\n",
    "3. **Reassembly** — Frames are recombined into a stylised video and GIF.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcomes:**\n",
    "- Stylised videos retain temporal coherence while exhibiting the chosen artistic style.\n",
    "- Multiple style applications demonstrate model versatility.\n"

    "### 4.5 Animated Transitions (Batch Generation)\n",
    "\n",
    "An important component of stylisation evaluation is the ability to visualise how style gradually emerges from the original content image. Animated transitions provide an intuitive way to demonstrate this progression. Following prior work in neural style transfer visualisations (Gatys et al., 2016; Huang & Belongie, 2017), I created **smooth fade animations** that transition from the **content image → style image → final stylised output**. These animations enhance interpretability by showing not just the static end result, but also the intermediate perceptual blending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each animation is constructed using a linear interpolation between pixel values of the content, style, and stylised output. I will extend my animated transition generator to run across **all stylised results** produced in Phase 4.1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For each triplet:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load **content**, **style**, and **stylised** images.  \n",
    "2. Create two smooth fade sequences:  \n",
    "   - Content → Style  \n",
    "   - Style → Stylised  \n",
    "3. Save the resulting GIF to `/output/gifs/`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures complete coverage of all models (Gatys, TF-Hub Johnson, AdaIN) and all content–style pairs, resulting in a comprehensive set of interpretable animations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Animations were generated at a fixed resolution of 512×512 pixels with a duration of ~2 seconds per segment, yielding visually coherent and high-quality GIFs. These will later be embedded directly into the report (see Phase 4.6).\n"

    "\n",
    "As an extension of this project, I developed a **Streamlit-based web app** that makes the NST system interactive and accessible beyond the Jupyter notebook environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the goal was to perform **full-image style transfer**, applying artistic stylization directly to the entire input image. However, I extended this work by integrating **object detection and masking**, enabling **selective neural style transfer**. For example, instead of stylizing the whole background, the system can isolate a specific object (such as a person, dog, or bus) and apply the artistic style only to that region. This makes the application more **creative, flexible, and practical**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implemented Features\n",
    "- **Upload content + style images** directly from the browser.  \n",
    "- **Camera input**: capture a live content image via webcam.  \n",
    "- **Model selection**: choose between Gatys, TF-Hub, or AdaIN.  \n",
    "- **α:β controls** (for Gatys): sliders to adjust content vs. style balance.  \n",
    "- **Live results preview** with options to download stylised outputs.  \n",
    "- **Sample gallery** showcasing pre-computed examples.  \n",
    "- **Selective style transfer via object detection**:  \n",
    "  - Person, dog, cat, bus, stop sign, airplane, etc.  \n",
    "  - Uses **Mask R-CNN** to generate a segmentation mask.  \n",
    "  - Applies NST only on detected objects while preserving the rest of the image.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why AdaIN (Adaptive Instance Normalization)?\n",
    "Three main approaches were considered for NST:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gatys et al. (2015)** – The original optimization-based NST.  \n",
    "   - Pros: Very flexible, any style image can be used.  \n",
    "   - Cons: Very slow (requires iterative optimization per image).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Johnson et al. (2016)** – Fast feed-forward networks.  \n",
    "   - Pros: Extremely fast once trained.  \n",
    "   - Cons: Each model is trained for a *single style* → inflexible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **AdaIN (Huang & Belongie, 2017)** – Adaptive Instance Normalization.  \n",
    "   - Pros: Real-time performance *and* supports arbitrary styles.  \n",
    "   - Cons: Slightly less fine-grained quality compared to Gatys.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, **AdaIN** was chosen as the default model because it balances **speed, flexibility, and usability in a web app setting**. Users can upload **any style image**, and the system generates results within seconds, which is crucial for an interactive demo.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Still, the **Gatys implementation** was included for academic completeness, and the **Johnson model** was tested as an example of fast single-style transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Stack\n",
    "- **Frontend/UI**: Streamlit (for interactive uploads, sliders, and live previews).  \n",
    "- **Backend NST models**:  \n",
    "  - TensorFlow (for Gatys + TF-Hub implementations).  \n",
    "  - PyTorch (for AdaIN + object detection).  \n",
    "- **Object detection & masking**:  \n",
    "  - `torchvision.models.detection.maskrcnn_resnet50_fpn`  \n",
    "  - Segmentation masks used to isolate objects for selective style transfer.  \n",
    "- **Deployment**: GitHub + Streamlit Cloud (planned for public demo).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "The Python dependencies were used (to be listed in `requirements.txt`):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose & Impact\n",
    "- Makes NST **accessible to peers and non-technical users**.  \n",
    "- Showcases how NST can evolve from a **research notebook → real-world app**.  \n",
    "- Demonstrates an **extra contribution**: selective style transfer with object detection.  \n",
    "- Provides a platform for **peer testing, artistic creativity, and future research extensions** (e.g., transformer-based NST or real-time mobile apps).  "

    "## Phase 9 — Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Achievements\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully explored **Neural Style Transfer (NST)** across multiple models and evaluation strategies. Beginning with the foundational *Gatys et al.* optimisation-based method, extending to the *TF-Hub Johnson* fast feed-forward approach, and culminating in the real-time *Adaptive Instance Normalisation (AdaIN)* model, the project demonstrated the **evolution of NST methods** in terms of both artistic quality and computational efficiency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Key outcomes include:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-model pipeline**: Implemented Gatys, TF-Hub Johnson, and AdaIN in a unified framework.  \n",
    "- **Batch stylisation**: Automated grid-based generation for all content–style pairs.  \n",
    "- **Style ratio control**: Explored α:β weighting (content vs. style balance) with side-by-side comparisons.  \n",
    "- **Dynamic outputs**: Generated animations, GIFs, and videos including multi-style video comparisons.  \n",
    "- **Evaluation**: Combined quantitative (SSIM, LPIPS, execution time) and qualitative (peer feedback survey) measures.  \n",
    "- **Interactivity**: Designed sliders and comparison tools inside the notebook for deeper engagement.  \n",
    "- **Accessibility focus**: Connected results to visual accessibility and inclusive AI applications.  \n",
    "- **Extension work**: Designed a roadmap for a *Streamlit app* allowing camera/upload-based NST with user-adjustable parameters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lessons Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trade-offs between methods**  \n",
    "   - *Gatys*: High artistic detail, but slow and computationally expensive.  \n",
    "   - *TF-Hub Johnson*: Balanced quality and speed, suitable for general use.  \n",
    "   - *AdaIN*: Near real-time, flexible for arbitrary styles, making it most practical for deployment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluation is multi-faceted**  \n",
    "   - **SSIM** captured *structural fidelity* but underrated stylisation quality.  \n",
    "   - **LPIPS** aligned more closely with human perception of style transfer success.  \n",
    "   - **Peer feedback** highlighted usability and interactivity as crucial success factors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Accessibility and inclusion**  \n",
    "   - Creative AI tools can enhance the experiences of users with disabilities by amplifying contrast, texture, or artistic detail.  \n",
    "   - Engagement with peers confirmed that interactive comparisons made the system easier to understand for lay users.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transformer-based NST** (e.g., SANet, StyTr²) for higher-quality and more controllable transfers.  \n",
    "- **Real-time deployment**: Extend the Streamlit app into a fully hosted web application.  \n",
    "- **Scalability**: Apply NST to longer videos or live streaming scenarios.  \n",
    "- **User studies**: Larger-scale evaluation with diverse participants, including users with low vision, to assess inclusivity impacts.  \n",
    "- **Creative applications**: Incorporate NST into digital art, education, and cultural heritage preservation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection on Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "This project not only replicated existing NST methods but also went beyond by:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integrating three different NST approaches in one pipeline.**  \n",
    "- **Combining quantitative, qualitative, and interactive evaluation.**  \n",
    "- **Delivering “wow factor” outputs**: video stylisation, multi-style comparisons, interactive sliders.  \n",
    "- **Laying groundwork for a deployable app** that brings state-of-the-art AI art tools to wider audiences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By achieving these objectives, the project stands as both a **technical success** and a **creative exploration** of how AI can enhance accessibility, interactivity, and artistic expression.  \n"
